# Wordle
Wordle Project I made in my senior year of high school. I wanted to challenge myself in order to learn Python better, so I challenged myself to make Wordle in under 24 hours. Hope you enjoy!


Hello!

This is my Wordle game that I created in my senior year of high school. I was inspired to make this game
because my friends and I would enjoy trying to solve the Wordle each day during our snack period. We are
all highly competitive which made this a really fun tradition for us, and it inspired me to try to make
Wordle myself as a way to get better at using Python. I also challenged myself to do it in under 24 hours,
and I was able to do so in the middle of week alongside keeping up with my schoolwork. Overall, this was a 
really fun project to work on, and I'm happy that I got to create the game that brings my friends and I so 
much joy.

Thanks for checking this out and feel free to message me about any questions or if you want any additional
features.
